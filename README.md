## Synopsis

It starts by using the [CoreFiling True North Platform][] API to request a list of validation
profiles, then presents a form for choosing one and uploading a file. It submits this
to the Document Service and polls for the validation status.

Once the document has been processed it displays the valdiation status
and displays table renderings provided by the Table Rendering API.
This uses Table Linkbase if the taxonomy includes it, otherwise
synthesizes table layouts automatically.

## Running the server


## Development prerequisites

Install node@>=6.0.0, npm@>=4.0.0 and yarn@>=1.0.0

```bash
yarn install
```


## Storybook

```bash
yarn storybook
```

and visit <http://localhost:6006/>.

Storybook entries are for a component in module `foo.tsx` go in a module next to it called `foo-stories.tsx`.


## Unit tests

Single run:

```bash
yarn test
```

Watch files:

```bash
yarn test-debug
```

## Simple server

A [simple server][1] provides authentication on the CoreFiling True North
Platform and adds credentials to API calls.
You need an OAuth2 client ID and  secret obtained from
CoreFiling. Pass these to the server as environment variables:

```bash
export CLIENT_ID=id-of-client
export CLIENT_SECRET=secret
yarn start
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080/xbrl-document-change-report/>.

## Development server

This watches the source files and reruns the Webpack build when they change.
It attempts hot reloading of modules and style sheets.

You need `HOST` to be a name for your development machine for which SSL
certificates are available.

```bash
npm config set @cfl/xbrl-document-change-report:devserver-host $HOST
npm run dev:server
```

Then open `https://$HOST:9091/xbrl-document-change-report/`

### SSL

The dev server uses HTTPS, with certificates copied in to `.dev/`.


## Build

```bash
yarn compile
```


## Package

```bash
yarn pack # Produces cfl-xbrl-document-change-report-$VERSION.tgz
```
